# Architecto

Architecto is a command line tool for generating project structures based on different microservices architectures, specifically designed for use with Node.js.

## Installation

To install Architecto, you can use npm:

`npm install -g architecto-node`

## Usage

To use Architecto, run the following command:

`architecto start <microserviceType>`


Replace `<microserviceType>` with one of the following options:
- `monolithic`
- `microservices`
- `serverless`

For example, to create a project structure for a monolithic architecture, you can run:

`architecto start monolithic`


Architecto will prompt you to enter a folder name, and then it will create the project structure based on the chosen microservice architecture.
