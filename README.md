# Architecto

Architecto is a command line tool for generating project structures based on different microservices architectures.

## Installation

To install Architecto, you can use npm:

npm install -g architecto


## Usage

To use Architecto, run the following command:

architecto start <microserviceType>

Replace `<microserviceType>` with one of the following options:
- `monolithic`
- `microservices`
- `serverless`

For example, to create a project structure for a monolithic architecture, you can run:

architecto start monolithic



Architecto will prompt you to enter a folder name, and then it will create the project structure based on the chosen microservice architecture.
